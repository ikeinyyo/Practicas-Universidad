Norms that must observe functions in order to be included in JavaVis
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- An example of execution, with the original image (the test images provided with JavaVis can 
  be used) and the result one, indicating the parameters used.
- JIPException must be thrown
- The function must contain enough comments so that the function can be understood. 
  At the beginning of the class a generic text (in English, of course) must appear. 
  This is an example of Binarize function.
  
/**
 * It converts a BYTE image into a binary image. To do that, a pixel in the output image 
 * is 1 if the value in the corresponding input image is between the range [u1, u2], and 
 * 0 otherwise.<br />
 * It applies to BYTE image.<br /><br />
 * <strong>Input parameters:</strong><br />
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>img</em>: The input image. It has to be a BYTE type.</li>
 * <li><em>u1</em>: Integer value which indicates the lower bound of the range to considerer the 
 * pixel as 1 (default 128).</li>
 * <li><em>u2</em>: Integer value which indicates the upper bound of the range to considerer the 
 * pixel as 1 (default 255).</li>
 * </ul><br />
 * <strong>Image result:</strong><br />
 * <ul>
 * <li>The original image in BIT type.</li>
 * </ul><br />
